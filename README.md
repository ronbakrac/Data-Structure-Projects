# Data-Structure-Projects
A collection of smaller projects showcasing understand in creating and utilizing many different data structures

The files in the base directory are standalone and can be compiled simply using g++ -std=c++11 <name>.cpp, although the output for these files are mostly test cases to ensure working functionality of the program. Feel free to edit.
Folders contain more advanced data structure related projects, seperate readmes included in them.
